##Change Log
	Beta 2.0.1		Adjusted default prices for cannabis to reflect actual value (taking into account modern medicianl value and hemp value in Colonial & World Wars eras).
					Added dabs, a refined version of cannabis made with a pharmaceutical factory.
	Beta 2.0.2		Added edibles, a processed version of dabs made with a chocolate factory. 
					Making edibles significantly increases workforce and budget but effectivley doubles product volume and can be traded for increased relations.
	Beta 2.0.3		Adjusted foriegn relations for trading edibles.
	Beta 2.0.4		Added blunt production to cigar factory. Adds 4 workers, low budget impact, 3:4 output ratio.
	Beta 2.0.5		Added another production line for dabs. & Added joint production to cigar factory. Adds 1 workers, low budget impact, 1:4 output ratio. (lower final value)
	Beta 2.0.6		Fixed syntax errors, typos, etc.
	Beta 2.0.7		Re-balanced cannabis based exports.
	Beta 2.0.8		Updated trades.
	Beta 2.1.0		Beta tested content thoroughly. Re-balanced values. Retested.
	Beta 2.1.1		Reduced "Toasted Workers" & "Stoned Workers" buffs on Cigar Factory. (Total bonus reduced from 35 to 20; got a little un-balanced late game)
	Beta 2.1.2		Added "Hippy Commune" upgrade to Cannabis Plantation.
	Beta 2.1.3		Beta tested and adjusted Hippy Commune values.
	Ver. 1.0.0		Seperated custom code into seperate mod, originally was chopped into DarthPresedente's "Drug Trade" mod.
	Ver. 1.1.0		Added new factory and resource. The Hemp Factory will process Cannabis into Hemp, which is more valuable earlier in the game.
	Ver. 1.1.1		Re-organized code, improved commenting.
	Ver. 1.1.2		Fixed bug preventing Hippy Commune upgrade from appearing.
	Ver. 1.1.3		Added hemp fiber upgrades to textile mill and fashion company.
	Ver. 1.2.0		Added biofuel plant, intakes hemp and ouputs power. Comparable to standard Power Plant.
					Originally was meant to intake hemp and corn, but the base game does not support power production which depends on two resources. Could be possible with additional modding in the future however.
	Ver. 1.2.1		Added 8 new trade routes for hemp.

##Bugs
